Image Processing Questions
==========================

We will start by assuming you now have properly calibrated science images, that is, images that have been bias-subtracted, dark-subtracted, and flat-fielded.  You need to ask yourself some questions regarding any need you might have for additional images.

.. todo::

	#. Do you need to stack images in order to bring out faint features in your images?  If so, what images do you need to stack to produce what final images.  How will you make sure the stacked images are aligned? 

        + If you are stacking *science* images you will need to align them first. Instructions for aligning are at http://physics.mnstate.edu/craig/astro_project/align.html#align-the-images
        + If you need them, instructions for stacking are at http://physics.mnstate.edu/craig/image_stats/stats_1.html#different-ways-of-combining-average-vs-median


Once you have answered the question(s) above and have addressed them, then you know what you need to create your final science images.
