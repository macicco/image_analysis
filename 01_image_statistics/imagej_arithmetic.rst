Image Arithmetic in AstroImageJ
================================


AstroImageJ can do basic arithmetic with images: add, subtract, multiply, and divide them. To do arithmetic, go to the `Process` menu, and select either `Image Calculator` or `Image/stack calculator` (which you select depends on whether there is the toolbar or an image is on top).

.. warning::

    *Always* have AstroImageJ display the result in a new window; you want to be sure to avoid accidentally overwriting or modifying the original data.
    
Let's try a couple things to make sure you understand what the image calculator does.

.. todo::

    #. Imagine subtracting an image from itself. What should the result be? Use AstroImageJ to subtract an image from itself. Does the result match your expectaion?
    #. Imagine dividing an image by itself. What should the result be? Use AstroImageJ to divide an image by itself. Does the result match your expectation.
