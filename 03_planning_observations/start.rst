Before you begin
================

+ Open a browser window to SIMBAD at http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/
+ Download *JSkyCalc.zip* from D2L and unpack the contents to work with as you did in the last lecture on Tuesday.
+ Open *JSkyCalc.jar* for use later.  If you are running this on your own computer, you may have to install Java Runtime Environment first before trying to open the jar file.
